# STX paint

STX paint is a drawing tool combining [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create custom brushes.

This tool was designed and developed by [Siiri TÃ¤nnler](https://www.siiritaennler.ch/) and mentored by [Ted Davis](https://teddavis.org/).

A first version of this tool was created in collaboration with Sarah Choi and Yevheniia Semenova during a class taught by Ted Davis at IDCE MA HGK/FHNW.
