# STX paint

STX paint is a drawing tool combining [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create custom brushes

select a brush and adjust its appearance with the sliders  
or live code the brush in the editor (+ show)

love your drawing? → save (to download as png)  
want to share it with us? → submit  
hate it? → trash

want to fill a sketchbook? → add your drawing to the print queue  
ready to print? → print

this tool was designed and developed by [Siiri Tännler](https://www.siiritaennler.ch/) and mentored by [Ted Davis](https://teddavis.org/)

a first version of this tool was created in collaboration with Sarah Choi and Yevheniia Semenova during a class on making tools with p5.js and hydra, taught by Ted Davis at [IDCE MA HGK/FHNW](https://www.fhnw.ch/en/degree-programmes/art-and-design/master-of-arts/master-of-arts-fhnw-in-design-digital-communication-environments)
